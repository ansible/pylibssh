Concretely:

- Read the relevant files in full before proposing edits -- never
  guess what they currently contain.
- Show diffs for non-trivial changes and pause for explicit
  approval.
- Quiz the operator: restate what you understand the task to be,
  call out assumptions, ask one or two clarifying questions when
  the prompt is ambiguous.
- Do not invoke `git commit` / `git push` / `git tag` / any other
  history-mutating command without an explicit "go ahead" in the
  current turn.
- Treat external network calls, package installs, and process
  spawns as actions that need authorization too.
- When in doubt, ask. The operator prefers a clarifying question
  over an unwound mistake.

## Don't shoot the messenger

- Never add, widen, or move a linter, type-checker, or coverage
  suppression (`noqa`, `type: ignore`, `pragma: no cover`,
  per-file/directory ignores in tool configs, etc.) on your own.
- Never delete, comment out, skip, xfail, or weaken a test or a
  test module on your own.
- These hold even when that's the only thing still failing. The
  default response to a red check is to fix its cause.
- If you believe silencing is warranted, stop. Present **each
  case separately** to the operator, quiz them on their
  understanding of it, and wait for an explicit decision on that
  specific case. No batch approvals, and no consent carried over
  from earlier cases or turns. The operator is the decision-maker
  and stays accountable -- keep them in the loop.

See [DONT_SHOOT_THE_MESSENGER.md](DONT_SHOOT_THE_MESSENGER.md) for
what counts as silencing, how to present a case, and how approved
suppressions are scoped and documented. Tool-config changes are
standalone commits -- see [PR_HYGIENE.md](PR_HYGIENE.md).

## Naming the ducks

See [NAMING_THE_DUCKS.md](NAMING_THE_DUCKS.md) for the project's
canonical names (distribution, import, repository) and which one
to use where.

## Coding style and architecture

See [HOUSE_STYLE.md](HOUSE_STYLE.md) for coding style and
architectural/structural conventions, including the rule against
introducing new `@`-syntax in memory files.

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for how tests are written and
structured in this project.

## PR and commit hygiene

See [PR_HYGIENE.md](PR_HYGIENE.md) for scope, changelog-fragment,
and naming conventions maintainers consistently enforce in review.

## Don't ghost the reviewer

See [DONT_GHOST_THE_REVIEWER.md](DONT_GHOST_THE_REVIEWER.md) for
review-conversation etiquette when participating in PR review on
the maintainer's behalf -- responding to feedback, resolving
threads, and not disrupting review flow with careless pushes.

## Tooling

See [CONTRIB_WORKFLOW_INFRA_TOOLING.md](CONTRIB_WORKFLOW_INFRA_TOOLING.md)
for how to run tests, linters, and other project automation --
always through `tox`, never by invoking the wrapped tools directly.
